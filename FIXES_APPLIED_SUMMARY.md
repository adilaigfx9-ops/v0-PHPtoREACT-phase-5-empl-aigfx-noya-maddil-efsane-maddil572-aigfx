# ✅ FIXES APPLIED - MAKING WEBSITE FULLY DYNAMIC

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **IN PROGRESS**

---

## 🎯 Issues Identified & Fixed

### ❌ Problem 1: Website Using Mock Data Instead of Database
**Issue:** Frontend was configured to read from JSON files instead of database

**Fix Applied:** ✅
- Created `.env` file with `VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=false`
- Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend will now fetch from real database via APIs

**File Created:** `/workspace/.env`

---

### ❌ Problem 2: Portfolio Highlights Component (Homepage) - Hardcoded
**Issue:** Portfolio section on homepage had hardcoded data, couldn't be edited from admin panel

**Fix Applied:** ✅
- Added `useState` and `useEffect` hooks
- Implemented API call to `fetchPortfolio()`
- Added loading skeleton for better UX
- Now fetches first 4 portfolio items from database
- Admin panel edits will appear on homepage

**File Modified:** `/workspace/src/components/portfolio-highlights.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before:
const portfolioItems = [hardcoded array]

// After:
const [portfolioItems, setPortfolioItems] = useState([])
useEffect(() => fetchPortfolio(), [])
```

### ❌ Problem 3: Testimonials Section (Homepage) - Hardcoded
**Issue:** Testimonials on homepage had hardcoded data, couldn't be edited from admin panel

**Fix Applied:** ✅
- Added `useState` and `useEffect` hooks
- Implemented API call to `fetchTestimonials()`
- Added loading skeleton for better UX
- Now fetches first 3 testimonials from database
- Admin panel edits will appear on homepage

**File Modified:** `/workspace/src/components/testimonials-section.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before:
const testimonials = [hardcoded array]

// After:
const [testimonials, setTestimonials] = useState([])
useEffect(() => fetchTestimonials(), [])
```

## ⚠️ Still To Fix

### ❌ Problem 4: Services Page (/services) - Still Hardcoded
**Issue:** Full services page at `/services` has hardcoded pricing packages

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING

**File:** `/workspace/src/pages/Services.tsx`

**What Needs to be Done:**
Replace the hardcoded `services` array (lines 7-190) with API call to `fetchServices()`

**Complexity:** Medium (large hardcoded array, complex structure)
