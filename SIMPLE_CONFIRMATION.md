## 1. Frontend React = Static HTML âœ…

**After you run:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**You get:**
- `dist/index.html` - ONE static HTML file
- `dist/assets/*.js` - Static JavaScript files
- `dist/assets/*.css` - Static CSS files

**These files:**
- Are STATIC (don't change)
- Upload ONCE to server
- Code structure is FIXED

**Result:** âœ… Frontend is STATIC HTML

## 2. All Content = Editable from Admin Panel âœ…

**Every piece of content you see on the website comes from the database:**

| What User Sees | Source | Editable? |
|----------------|--------|-----------|
| Blog posts | Database â†’ /api/blogs.php | âœ… Admin Panel â†’ Blogs |
| Portfolio projects | Database â†’ /api/portfolio.php | âœ… Admin Panel â†’ Portfolio |
| Services & prices | Database â†’ /api/services.php | âœ… Admin Panel â†’ Services |

## ðŸŽ¯ Simple Explanation

**Think of it like this:**

**Frontend (Static):**
- The "container" or "frame"
- Built once with `npm run build`
- Doesn't change when you add content

**Content (Dynamic):**
- The "stuff inside the container"
- Stored in database
- Changed anytime via admin panel
- NO rebuild needed

**Together:**
- Static container + Dynamic content = Perfect website!
