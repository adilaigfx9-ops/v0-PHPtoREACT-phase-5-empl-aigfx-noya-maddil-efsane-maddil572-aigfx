**Solution:** Open browser console (F12), check for API errors, verify backend is accessible

### Issue: Modal doesn't open
**Solution:** Check browser console for JavaScript errors, verify all data arrays are defined

### Issue: Save fails
**Solution:** Check API endpoint exists, verify form validation passes, check network tab
