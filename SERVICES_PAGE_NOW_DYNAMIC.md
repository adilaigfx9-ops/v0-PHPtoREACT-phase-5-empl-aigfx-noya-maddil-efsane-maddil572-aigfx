## 🎨 Color & Style Customization

### Currently:
- Button colors use CSS classes (bg-gradient-youtube)
- Text colors use predefined classes (text-youtube-red)
- These are controlled by TailwindCSS configuration

### To Customize Colors:
You can edit in `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
colors: {
  'youtube-red': '#FF0000',  // Change primary color
  'foreground': '#1F2937',   // Change text color
}
```

### Future Enhancement (Optional):
Could add a "Settings" section in admin panel for:
- Primary brand color
- Secondary color
- Button color
- Text color
- Font family

This would require:
1. Adding `brand_colors` JSON field to settings table
2. Injecting CSS variables from settings
3. Using those variables in components
