## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Changes don't appear on website
**Solutions:**
1. Did you rebuild frontend? (`npm run build`)
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check if .env file exists: `cat /workspace/.env`
4. Verify VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=false in .env
5. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Problem: "Failed to fetch" errors
**Solutions:**
1. Check if backend server is running
2. Verify API_BASE_URL in .env matches your server
3. Check CORS settings in backend
4. Verify database connection in config.php

### Problem: Skeleton loaders don't disappear
**Solutions:**
1. API might be returning empty arrays
2. Add data in admin panel first
3. Check API endpoint directly: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/blogs.php`
